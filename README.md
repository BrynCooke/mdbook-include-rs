# mdbook-include-rs

A preprocessor for [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that lets you include code from external Rust source files with extraction capabilities. This makes it easy to maintain code examples that are always in sync with your actual codebase.

## Features

- Include entire source files or just the parts you need (specific functions, methods, structs, etc.)
- Automatically include dependencies for functions when needed
- Show only function bodies when desired, with supporting types shown separately
- Extract methods from structs and trait implementations cleanly
- Your code examples stay as regular source files that you can compile and test

## Installation

First, install the preprocessor:

```bash
cargo install mdbook-include-rs
```

Then, modify your `book.toml` file:

```toml
[book]
title = "My Book"
authors = ["Your Name"]

# Add the preprocessor to your mdBook
[preprocessor.include-rs]

# Optional: Specify a base directory for all file paths
# If not provided, paths will be relative to each markdown file's directory
# [preprocessor.include-rs]
# base-dir = "examples"
```

## Usage Examples

### Include a Complete Source File

To include an entire source file:

````markdown
```rust
#![source_file!("source_file.rs")]
```
````

This will include the entire contents of the file, with `use` statements automatically filtered out for cleaner output.

### Include Just a Function Body

To include just the body of a specific function (without the function declaration):

````markdown
```rust
#![function_body!("source_file.rs", hello_world)]
```
````

The output will only contain the content inside the function body, not the function declaration itself.

### Include a Function with Dependencies

If your function depends on other types or functions, you can include them too:

````markdown
```rust
#![function_body!("src/models.rs", User::display_profile, [struct User, trait Displayable, impl Displayable for User])]
```
````

This will include:
1. The `User` struct definition
2. The `Displayable` trait definition
3. The implementation of `Displayable` for `User`
4. And finally, the body of the `display_profile` method

The dependencies will be included in the order you list them, with the main function's body appearing last.

### Dependency Types

You can include various types of dependencies:

- `struct StructName` - includes a struct definition
- `enum EnumName` - includes an enum definition
- `trait TraitName` - includes a trait definition
- `impl StructName` - includes all methods in an impl block for a struct
- `impl StructName::method_name` - includes a specific method from an impl block
- `impl TraitName for StructName` - includes a trait implementation
- `function_name` - includes another function

## Real-World Example

For a document explaining user authentication:

````markdown
# User Authentication

Our system handles authentication with a simple API:

```rust
{{#function_body!("src/auth.rs", authenticate_user, [struct Credentials, struct User, fn validate_password])}}
```

Behind the scenes, password hashing works like this:

```rust
{{#function_body!("src/auth.rs", hash_password)}}
```
````

## How It Works

The preprocessor:

1. Parses your markdown looking for code blocks with `include-doc` directives
2. Uses Rust's `syn` library to parse and extract the requested code elements
3. Formats the extracted code with proper syntax highlighting
4. Replaces the directive in your markdown with the extracted code

## Command Line Interface

As per the mdBook preprocessor standard:

```bash
# Check if the preprocessor supports a renderer
mdbook-include-doc supports <renderer>

# Process a book
mdbook-include-doc pre-process <path-to-book>
```
